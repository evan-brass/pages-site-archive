				<h2>City Thing</h2>
				<p class="description">I was playing around with Javascript's Math.random and color.adobe.com to make
                an "Ambient" something or other.  Hows that for unspecific!</p>

				<h2>Dotty</h2>
				<p class="description">I had an idea for something that would take pictures and almost pixelate them.  There are two versions: <a href="Dotty">Dotty</a> and <a href="dotty_v1">dotty_v1</a> (Which was my first attempt).</p>

				<h2>Mandelbrot Visualizer</h2>
				<p class="description">I should have done so much more with this.  Things like letting you zoom in, using workers for the rendering, and all the clever canvas stuff that people do.  Well, it just makes a full scale Mandelbrot.</p>

			<p>I've been playing with Electron, React and all of the array functions (filter, sort, map, etc.).
			The result is a calendar type application.  It would need a lot of features (like being able
			to select the time of day for an event, multiple day events, etc.) to make it useful.  But, it's
			fun to work on.</p>
